	Badminton is a racquet sport played using racquets to hit a shuttlecock across a net. Although it may be played with larger teams, 
the most common forms of the game are "singles" (with one player per side) and "doubles" (with two players per side). Badminton is often 
played as a casual outdoor activity in a yard or on a beach; formal games are played on a rectangular indoor court. Points are scored by 
striking the shuttlecock with the racquet and landing it within the opposing side's half of the court. Each side may only strike the shuttlecock 
once before it passes over the net. Play ends once the shuttlecock has struck the floor or if a fault has been called by the umpire, service 
judge, or (in their absence) the opposing side.

	The shuttlecock is a feathered or (in informal matches) plastic projectile which flies differently from the balls used in many other 
sports. In particular, the feathers create much higher drag, causing the shuttlecock to decelerate more rapidly. Shuttlecocks also have a high 
top speed compared to the balls in other racquet sports. The flight of the shuttlecock gives the sport its distinctive nature. The game developed 
in British India from the earlier game of battledore and shuttlecock. European play came to be dominated by Denmark but the game has became very 
popular in Asia, with recent competitions dominated by China. Since 1992, badminton has been a Summer Olympic sport with five events: men's singles, 
women's singles, men's doubles, women's doubles, and mixed doubles. At high levels of play, the sport demands excellent fitness: players require 
aerobic stamina, agility, strength, speed, and precision. It is also a technical sport, requiring good motor coordination and the development of 
sophisticated racquet movements.



<li><b>Singles</b></li>

	Since one person needs to cover the entire court, singles tactics are based on forcing the opponent to move as much as possible; this means 
that singles strokes are normally directed to the corners of the court. Players exploit the length of the court by combining lifts and clears with 
drop shots and net shots. Smashing tends to be less prominent in singles than in doubles because the smasher has no partner to follow up his effort 
and is thus vulnerable to a skillfully placed return. Moreover, frequent smashing can be exhausting in singles where the conservation of a player's 
energy is at a premium. However, players with strong smashes will sometimes use the shot to create openings, and players commonly smash weak returns 
to try to end rallies. In singles, players will often start the rally with a forehand high serve or with a flick serve. Low serves are also used 
frequently, either forehand or backhand. Drive serves are rare. At high levels of play, singles demands extraordinary fitness. Singles is a game of 
patient positional manoeuvring, unlike the all-out aggression of doubles.[19]

<li><b>Doubles</b></li>

	Both pairs will try to gain and maintain the attack, smashing downwards when the opportunity arises. Whenever possible, a pair will adopt an 
ideal attacking formation with one player hitting down from the rearcourt, and his partner in the midcourt intercepting all smash returns except the 
lift. If the rearcourt attacker plays a dropshot, his partner will move into the forecourt to threaten the net reply. If a pair cannot hit downwards, 
they will use flat strokes in an attempt to gain the attack. If a pair is forced to lift or clear the shuttlecock, then they must defend: they will 
adopt a side-by-side position in the rear midcourt, to cover the full width of their court against the opponents' smashes. In doubles, players generally 
smash to the middle ground between two players in order to take advantage of confusion and clashes. At high levels of play, the backhand serve has 
become popular to the extent that forehand serves have become fairly rare at a high level of play. The straight low serve is used most frequently, in an 
attempt to prevent the opponents gaining the attack immediately. Flick serves are used to prevent the opponent from anticipating the low serve and 
attacking it decisively. At high levels of play, doubles rallies are extremely fast. Men's doubles is the most aggressive form of badminton, with a high 
proportion of powerful jump smashes and very quick reflex exchanges. Because of this, spectator interest is sometimes greater for men's doubles than for 
singles.

<li><b>Mixed doubles</b></li>
	
	In mixed doubles, both pairs typically try to maintain an attacking formation with the woman at the front and the man at the back. This is because 
the male players are usually substantially stronger, and can therefore produce smashes that are more powerful. As a result, mixed doubles require greater 
tactical awareness and subtler positional play. Clever opponents will try to reverse the ideal position, by forcing the woman towards the back or the man 
towards the front. In order to protect against this danger, mixed players must be careful and systematic in their shot selection. At high levels of play, 
the formations will generally be more flexible: the top women players are capable of playing powerfully from the back-court, and will happily do so if 
required. When the opportunity arises, however, the pair will switch back to the standard mixed attacking position, with the woman in front and men in 
the back.
